## Using this Task Definition
This task definition pulls the official Wildfly image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/wildfly/) and boots the application server in standalone mode with admin console available remotely.

### Steps to Run:
* Have an active [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).
* Create an [Amazon ECS cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create_cluster.html).
* This task definition is a template that can then be pasted into the AWS console JSON input area or saved to a file and used with the AWS CLI. You can easily replace the existing Docker image in this task definition with your own.
* Run the task definition as a [Task](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) or [Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).

#### ECS CLI Commands
`aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://<path_to_json_file>/wildfly.json`

## More Info
#### What is a Task Definition?
A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. Some of the parameters you can specify in a task definition include:

* Which Docker images to use with the containers in your task.
* How much CPU and memory to use with each container.
* The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in your task.

Please see the [Amazon ECS Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) for more information on writing and running Task Definitions.

#### About Amazon ECS
Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. Learn more [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs).
